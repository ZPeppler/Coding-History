                <h2>Tour 1872 Columbia</h2>
				<p class="index" align="justify">Founded in 1786, Columbia was South Carolina’s second capital. During Reconstruction little growth occurred outside of the two mile square Columbia’s original city limits largely due to the amount of rebuilding necessary following the Civil War. However, the construction boom that followed the war brought not only rebuilt businesses and houses, it introduced new governmental, spiritual and recreational structures to the cityscape.</p>
                <p>Take a walking tour of historic Columbia in 1872 and explore the diverse state of the city.</p>
