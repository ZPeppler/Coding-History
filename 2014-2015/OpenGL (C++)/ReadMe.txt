Project 4

Machine used: ares.cse.sc.edu

Compile: make

Execute: ./Project4

Clean: make clean

Extra functions: Create a submenu on right click in the menu to change the depth size.

Note: Unable to display the depth size as requested in the top left. To potentially 
compensate, the depth size is displayed in the right click menu. 

This program recursively creates the sponge based on input either from the keyboard
(by default) or by the extra menu (extra function). By default the depth is set to 
2. It increases either by menu selection or - and + on the keyboard.
